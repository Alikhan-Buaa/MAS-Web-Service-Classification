1. Objective: Establish baseline performance for web service classification.
2. Dataset: Top-N categories (10, 20, 30, 40, 50).
3. Models: ML (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and DL (BiLSTM).
4. Features: TF-IDF and SBERT embeddings.
5. Evaluation: Top-1, Top-3, Top-5 accuracy, Macro/Micro F1, confusion matrices.
6. Balanced datasets with fixed 80/10/10 train/val/test splits.
7. Reproducible configurations stored in YAML files.
8. Benchmarking: Leaderboards, Top-K curves, and confusion matrices.
9. Total models trained: 40 (30 ML + 10 DL).
10. Analysis includes cross-model comparison, ranking quality, and category difficulty.
